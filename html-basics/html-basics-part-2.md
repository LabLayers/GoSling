# HTML Basics, Part 2

"You have made it onwards, you experienced coder."

"I am now going to teach you about Paragraphs."

"In writing, a paragraph is used to express an idea in one difinitive area, and in HTML it is used for the same thing."

"To use the Paragraph tag, open and close p tags, like this. \<p>\</p>"

````html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello World</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p><p>
  </body>
<html>
````

"Note: Paragraph tags are mainly used in the BODY of your HTML, not the HEAD."

"Now try writing your first paragraph in the body of your HTML. Remember that paragraph tags are \<p>\</p>"

````html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello World</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy doge.<p>
  </body>
<html>
````

"You can write whatever you want. Press continue when you are ready to move on."

"So now that you have learned paragraphs, I am going to teach you another type of text tag"

"Header tags create font that is usually easily differentiated from the paragraph tags."

"There are 6 different types of Header tags. The first one open and closes like this : \<h1>\</h1>"

````html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello World</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>A small poem</h1>
    <p>The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy doge.<p>
  </body>
<html>
````

"For every other Header tag, you just change the numbers, which range from 1-6. ex. \<h1>\</h1> or \<h3>\</h3>"

````html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello World</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>A small poem</h1>
    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading 5</h5>
    <p>The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy doge.<p>
  </body>
<html>
````

"Try making your own header AND paragraph now. You can change your header size by changing the numbers in your header tag"

"Click continue when you have finished."

"You have finished this text tutorial! Congrats.
